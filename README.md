# Sign Language Detection System

This repository is associated with the research paper on **"Sign Language Detection Systems"**, submitted for conference presentations (2025).

## Project Overview
I developed a comprehensive system for sign language recognition, including:
- Preparing a custom dataset for hand sign detection.
- Training a deep learning model for sign classification.
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model for gloss-to-text translation.

## Status
ðŸ”’ **Currently under review** for conference presentation.  
The full code, models, and datasets will be made publicly available after acceptance and presentation to comply with conference and publication guidelines.

## Stay Tuned
This repository will be updated with:
- Codebase
- Model weights
- Detailed documentation
- Final published paper

Thank you for your understanding and interest!
